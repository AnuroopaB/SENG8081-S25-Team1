1,"Fluctuations in economic time series are caused by seasonal, cyclical and irregular movements. A seasonally adjusted series is one from which seasonal movements have been eliminated. Seasonal movements are defined as those which are caused by regular annual events such as climate, holidays, vacation periods and cycles related to crops, production and retail sales associated with Christmas and Easter. It should be noted that the seasonally adjusted series contain irregular as well as longer-term cyclical fluctuations. The seasonal adjustment program is a complicated computer program which differentiates between these seasonal, cyclical and irregular movements in a series over a number of years and, on the basis of past movements, estimates appropriate seasonal factors for current data. On an annual basis, the historic series of seasonally adjusted data are revised in light of the most recent information on changes in seasonality.",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
2,"To ensure respondent confidentiality, estimates below a certain threshold are suppressed. For Canada, Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia suppression is applied to all data below 1,500. The threshold level for Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba and Saskatchewan is 500, while in Prince Edward Island, estimates under 200 are suppressed. For census metropolitan areas (CMAs) and economic regions (ERs), use their respective provincial suppression levels mentioned above.

6,"Gender refers to an individual's personal and social identity as a man, woman or non-binary person (a person who is not exclusively a man or a woman). Some people may not identify with a specific gender and a person's gender may change over time. Gender includes the following concepts: gender identity, which refers to the gender that a person feels internally and individually; gender expression, which refers to the way a person presents their gender, regardless of their gender identity, through body language, aesthetic choices or accessories (e.g., clothes, hairstyle and makeup), which may have traditionally been associated with a specific gender. A person's gender may differ from their sex at birth, and from what is indicated on their current identification or legal documents such as their birth certificate, passport or driver's license. LFS started collecting gender of person in 2022. Prior to 2022, LFS only collected information on sex of person (male or female), as declared by the respondent or recorded by the interviewer. The sex variable prior to 2022 and the two-category gender variable since 2022 are combined in this table. Although sex and gender refer to two different concepts, the introduction of gender is not expected to have a significant impact on data analysis and historical comparability, given the small size of the transgender and non-binary populations.",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown
